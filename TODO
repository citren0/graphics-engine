Enforce max_shapes.
Add debug compile flag for kernel timing printing.
Need to change shapes to contain polygons which have normal vectors.
    - Figure out how to efficiently copy shapes into opencl
        - Structs cannot contain pointers, but simple structs may be passed into opencl kernels.
    - Struct vector contains double arr size numhomogcoords, use for normal vectors and for each vertex?
Once that is done and all functions have been changed to accomodate this, calculate normal vectors of polygons when they're added. OBJ files include this data automatically.
Polygon fill algorithm, use the difference between normal vectors and camera vector to modify darkness so detail can be seen, further objects should be darker?
